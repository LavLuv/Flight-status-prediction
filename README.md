# Flight status prediction

Using a large dataset (consisting of numerous features of various flight-related measures) of multiple flights, through a Naive Bayes classifier, predicting the extent of delay (or earliness) of a particular flight  

Clearly, this can have many practical applications in the aviation industry, for analysts to identify the factors which might be having a hand in flight delays, as well as for flyers to get an idea of the probable time by which their flight may be delayed
